For this CodeReview, the following criteria will be graded:


 Create a nice looking responsive design. Feel free to use Bootstrap or just HTML/CSS.

    Implement an interface for the CRUD on Events:

    Event index page: all events should be listed here like in the image above (event name, event date and time). Feel free to use Bootstrap cards to display the events.

    Event view page (details page): when a user clicks on the event card/button, an event view page with all the data from that specific event should be displayed.

    Event edit page: on this page, it should be possible to edit the event data.

    Event add/create page: on this page, it should be possible to add a new event.

    Event delete option: a user should be able to delete an event from the database.
 
 
 Bonus Points:

    Create filtering depending on the event type.
